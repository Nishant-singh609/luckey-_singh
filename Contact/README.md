# BlockID

## 📝 Project Description

BlockID is a decentralized identity management system that allows users to register and manage their identities on the blockchain. Built using Solidity, the smart contract enables secure identity storage, verification by an authorized entity, and retrieval of user details.

## 🚀 Project Vision

To empower users with control over their digital identities by using blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable identity management system.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **User Registration:** Individuals can register their identity using their name and a unique national ID.
- **Owner Verification:** A designated authority (contract owner) can verify the identity of registered users.
- **Identity Lookup:** Public function to retrieve identity details, including verification status.
- **Unique ID Check:** Prevents reuse of national IDs across different addresses.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials.
- Role-based access for third-party verifiers (e.g., banks, employers).
- Frontend DApp for users to interact with the smart contract easily.
- On-chain KYC integration with zk-SNARKs for privacy-preserving verification.
